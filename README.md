# Database Management and SQL Analytics – Classic Models

Developed advanced SQL solutions using the Classic Models database to perform data extraction, transformation, and analytical reporting. The project demonstrates strong proficiency in SQL querying, database design, window functions, views, stored procedures, and triggers.

## Project Overview
- Demonstrates end-to-end SQL analytics and database management  
- Covers complex querying, data aggregation, and customer segmentation  
- Implements relational database design with constraints  
- Builds reusable database objects for automated reporting  
- Focuses on sales, payments, customers, and order analytics

## Tools and Technologies
- MySQL  
- MySQL Workbench  
- Classic Models Database  
- SQL (DDL, DML, DQL)  
- Window Functions  
- Stored Procedures  
- Views and Triggers  

---

## Key Objectives
- Perform advanced data retrieval using SELECT, JOINs, and subqueries  
- Implement customer segmentation using CASE statements  
- Analyze sales and payment trends using aggregations  
- Design relational tables with proper constraints  
- Build reusable views and stored procedures  
- Apply window functions for ranking and time-based analysis  
- Implement triggers and error handling mechanisms

## Tasks Implemented

### Data Retrieval and Filtering
- Used SELECT with WHERE, DISTINCT, and LIKE operators  
- Filtered Sales Representatives reporting to a specific manager  
- Extracted product lines matching defined patterns  

### Customer Segmentation
- Applied CASE statements to classify customers by region  
- Created derived column for customer segment reporting  

### Aggregation and Date Analysis
- Identified top products by total order quantity  
- Analyzed monthly payment frequency using date functions  
- Applied GROUP BY and HAVING clauses for filtering  

### Database Design with Constraints
- Created Customers and Orders tables  
- Implemented PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK, NOT NULL, and DEFAULT constraints  
- Ensured data integrity across relational tables  

### Join Operations
- Identified top shipping countries using multi-table joins  

### Self Join Analysis
- Built employee-manager hierarchy using self join  
- Retrieved employee and corresponding manager names  

### DDL Operations
- Created and altered Facility table  
- Added primary key, auto increment, and NOT NULL constraints  

### Views Implementation
- Created view `product_category_sales`  
- Calculated total sales and order count by product line  
- Enabled reusable category-level reporting  

### Stored Procedures
- Built parameterized procedure `Get_country_payments`  
- Generated year-wise and country-wise payment summaries  
- Formatted output in thousands (K)  

### Window Functions
- Ranked customers based on order frequency  
- Calculated year-over-year order growth  
- Used RANK, DENSE_RANK, LEAD, and LAG  

### Subquery Applications
- Identified product lines exceeding average buy price  
- Applied nested query logic for advanced filtering  

### Error Handling
- Created procedure with exception handling  
- Returned controlled error message on failure  

### Triggers
- Implemented BEFORE INSERT trigger  
- Ensured negative working hours are converted to positive values
